too .  In the process of learning through online courses , we usually communicate synchronously and asynchronously with 
others through the screen . And our interactive objects contain the vedio’s presenters , the “classmates” in the comment 
area , as well as ourselves . 

On the one hand , we learn knowledge and skills in different regions that we’re interested in from instructors that 
offering TED lectures and open cources coming from various universities and organizations , and expend our thoughts and 
ideas through communicating with “classmates” in the comment area . On the other hand , we engage in constructivist lear-
ning with ourselves during the process of mining , supplementing and building connections between knowledge fragments in 
our own brains .
